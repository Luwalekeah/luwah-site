## Design System

Brand tokens are defined in `src/app/globals.css` under `@theme`:

- **Background**: `#0A0F1E` (dark navy blue)
- **Copper**: `#B87333` (primary accent)
- **Lake Blue**: `#4A90A4` (secondary accent)
- **Display Font**: Century Gothic / Tw Cen MT
- **Body Font**: Open Sans

All colors, spacing, glassmorphism values, and transitions are CSS variables — change them in one place and they propagate everywhere.

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, React Server Components)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with CSS-first configuration
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (scroll-triggered, page transitions)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **CMS**: Sanity.io (to be connected)
- **Search**: Pagefind (to be integrated)
- **Email**: Resend (to be connected via API routes)
- **Bot Protection**: Cloudflare Turnstile (to be added)
- **Analytics**: Plausible (to be added)
- **Hosting**: Render
